Presto
-------------

The connector library [pyhive](https://pypi.org/project/PyHive/) comes with Superset out of the box. This is the recommended way to connect to Presto.

The expected connection string is formatted as follows:

```
hive://hive@{hostname}:{port}/{database}
```

By default Superset assumes the most recent version of Presto is being used when querying the datasource. If youâ€™re using an older version of Presto, you can configure it in the extra parameter:

```
{
    "version": "0.123"
}
```
