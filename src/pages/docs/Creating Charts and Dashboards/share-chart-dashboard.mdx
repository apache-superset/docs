Share Your Chart or Dashboard
---------------


Making a chart and dashboard is fun and all, but it doesn’t create much value unless you can share it with your colleague, team, or the entire organization! So let’s see how you can share your hard work with others in Superset.

### Share a Dashboard

In the Toolbar section of your dashboard, select the Edit dashboard drop-down arrow.
In the drop-down menu, select Share dashboard. It looks like this:


<img src="/images/share-dashboard-1.png" /> 


After you select this option, the Share Dashboard box appears. This box shows the URL of the dashboard.

Select the copy icon to copy the URL. At any time, you can paste the URL in a desired location to share with someone else.

You can also email the dashboard directly by selecting the envelope icon, which launches your default email app. Here's what it looks like on a Windows system when a default email app is not defined:

<img src="/images/share-dashboard-3.png" /> 

Depending on what type of OS you use, this may look different. 

The email is pre-populated with this information:

```
Subject: Superset Dashboard Name
Body: Check out this dashboard: URL
Where Name is the name of the dashboard and URL is...well the URL! :)
```

### Share a Chart
Here is how you can share a specific chart, either from within a dashboard or within the Chart Creation screen.

From within a dashboard:

Simply browse to a chart within a dashboard, select the vertical ellipsis (3 vertical dots), and then select “Share chart”:

<img src="/images/share-dashboard-4.png" /> 


Then just just copy the URL or email, and you're all set!
From within the Chart Creation screen:

While creating a chart, you can also copy the chart's URL or email it to a colleague. 
Above the chart, just select the link icon and follow the same processes as described above.

Voila! Now that you know how to share a chart and dashboard.
